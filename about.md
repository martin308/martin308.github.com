I am a software engineer living in San Francisco. You can find me
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/martin308) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/martin308).

I joined [Bugsnag](https://bugsnag.com) in 2015 to head up the backend team.

Prior to that I worked at [Mindscape](http://mindscapehq.com) and
[Intergen](http://www.intergen.co.nz) after graduating from
[Massey University](http://www.massey.ac.nz) with a Bachelor of Engineering.
