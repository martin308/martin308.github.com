I am a software engineer living in Wellington, New Zealand. You can find me
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/martin308) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/martin308).

I joined [Mindscape](http://www.mindscapehq.com) in 2013 and kicked off the development
of [Raygun](https://raygun.io), an error tracking service for developers.

Prior to that I worked at [Intergen](http://www.intergen.co.nz) for a few years after
graduating from [Massey University](http://www.massey.ac.nz) with a Bachelor of Engineering.
