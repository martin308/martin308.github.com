I am a developer from Wellington, New Zealand. Currently working at [Mindscape](http://www.mindscapehq.com) on an awesome new product for tracking errors in your application [Raygun.io](http://raygun.io). My main languages of choice are C# and JavaScript, although I love exposing my self to a wide range of languages.

Outside of work I love going Skiing and Snowboarding as much as I can, I also enjoy doing Judo, Taekwondo and weight training.
