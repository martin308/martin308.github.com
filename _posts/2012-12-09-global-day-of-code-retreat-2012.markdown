Yesterday [Amy](http://amy.palamounta.in) and I hosted and facilitated the Wellington [code retreat](http://coderetreat.org/) as part of the [global day of code retreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/). The day went well and we got a full house of developers to practice coding. We managed to get in 6 sessions and worked through a variety of constraints ranging from not using condtionals and only using 4 lines of code, through to not using any return values.

The retrospective went well and was good to see that most people seem to get alot out of the day. Big thanks to [Xero](http://www.xero.com) for providing us with a venue and to [Mindscape](http://www.mindscapehq.com) for providing us with food. Hopefully we will be able to organise another one of these in the future, maybe I'll even be able to do some coding at the next one ;)
