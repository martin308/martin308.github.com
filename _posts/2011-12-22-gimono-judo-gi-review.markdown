[Gimono](http://www.gimono.com) is a company from Dunedin creating martial arts uniforms out of
a material they call [Fortitude](http://www.gimono.com/fortitude/strength). I had been shown their
website a little while ago and they looked interesting. I recently ripped my Judogi at training so
was on the lookout for a new Gi when I saw Gimono had a special on I jumped on it.

###Durability
Gimono dont specify single or double weave on their site. Its alot thinner than my old single
weave Gi though. It seems to holding up pretty well so far, have done a bit of randori and it has
held up excellently.

###Flexibility/Mobility
As above the Gi is very thin so has excellent flexibility. I haven't felt constricted at all while
rolling in it. The fit is pretty loose as all Judogi are. Its main advantage over other Judogi is
how breathable it is. Its almost see through in places. This allows you to keep cool while doing an
intense workout. I have definelty experienced this and it is amazing how much cooler it is compared
to my old Gi.

###Material/Production Quality
The Fortitude material has a slightly odd feel to it, very slippery. It also stands out compared to
a 'normal' Judogi. So far it has kept its insane whiteness, we shall see how long that lasts!
The stitching seems to be very good, no complaints there either. The only complaint about the
material is the collar is a little thin so Gi chokes feel a little deeper than normal.

###Miscellaneous
Gimono has excellent customer service. I was initially sent an incorrect size in the pants, I was
immediatly sent a replacement and a prepaid courier bag to send the other pair back. Delivery time
was excellent and the pricing on special while not the cheapest Judogi is not a bad price compared
to other high end Gi. It also comes with a pretty sweet carry bag for with room for a Gi and a
front pocket for other bits.

###Closing comments
So far an excellent Judogi. Its a high quality Gi that is made in New Zealand!
An added bonus, is the excellent customer service.
