I have done some spring (autumn) cleaning and made a new theme for my blog. If you
use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and like it, you can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/martin308/left-stripe). It uses  [Pure.css](http://purecss.io) and is kind of responsive. It is based on the [blog layout](http://purecss.io/layouts/blog) with some tweaks. I will probably keep
hacking on it and add some more features so stay tuned.
